Want to contribute to the Flutter sample ecosystem? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at the end).

Is this the right place for your contribution?
This repo is used by members of the Flutter team and a few partners as a place to store example apps and demos. It's not meant to be the one and only source of truth for Flutter samples or the only place people go to learn about the best ways to build with Flutter. What that means in practice is that if you've written a great example app, it doesn't need to be maintained here in order to get noticed, be of help to new Flutter devs, and have an impact on the community.

You can maintain your sample app in your own repo (or with another source control provider) and still be as important a part of the Flutter-verse as anything you see here. You can let us know on the FlutterDev Google Group when you've published something and Tweet about it with the #FlutterDev hashtag.

So what should be contributed here, then?
Fixes and necessary improvements to the existing samples, mostly.

Before you contribute
File an issue first!
If you see a bug or have an idea for a feature that you feel would improve one of the samples already in the repo, please file an issue before you begin coding or send a PR. This will help prevent duplicate work by letting us know what you're up to. It will help avoid a situation in which you spend a lot of time coding something that's not quite right for the repo or its goals.

Sign the license agreement.
Before we can use your code, you must sign the Google Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

A few ground rules
This is monorepo containing a bunch of projects. While different codebases have different needs, there are a few basic conventions that every project here is expected to follow. All of them are based on our experience over the last couple years keeping the repo tidy and running smooth.

Each app should:

Be designed to build against the current stable release of the Flutter SDK.
Include the top level analysis_options.yaml file used throughout the repo. This file include a base set of analyzer conventions and lints.
Have no analyzer errors or warnings.
Be formatted with dart format.
Include at least one working test in its test folder.
Be wired into the list of projects in the CI scripts for stable, beta, and master, which runs the analyzer, the formatter, and flutter test.
Add the new project directory to the dependabot configuration to keep dependencies updated in an on-going basis.
Avoid adding an onerous amount of blobs (typically images or other assets) to the repo.
In addition, sample code is, at the end of the day, still code. It should be written with at least as much care as the Flutter code you'd find in the SDK itself. For that reason, most of the Flutter style guide also applies to code in this repo.

The experimental folder
Projects in the repo's top-level experimental directory are allowed to skirt some of the above rules. These apps are either experimental in nature or use APIs that haven't landed in the SDK's stable channel. They build against main, and aren't (by default) wired into our CI system.
